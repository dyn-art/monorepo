```json
{
	"name": "@dyn/example",
	"description": "Description of the package",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"private": true,
	"scripts": {
		"build": "shx rm -rf dist && ../../scripts/cli.sh bundle",
		"start:dev": "tsc -w",
		"lint": "eslint --ext .js,.ts src/",
		"clean": "shx rm -rf dist && shx rm -rf node_modules && shx rm -rf .turbo",
		"install:clean": "pnpm run clean && pnpm install",
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		"update:latest": "pnpm update --latest"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "https://github.com/dyn-art/monorepo.git"
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "@bennoinbeta",
	"license": "AGPL-3.0-or-later",

	// "devDependencies": {},
	"files": [
		// List of files to be included in your package
	]
}
```
