# Commercial Licensing

## Why We Use Commercial Licenses Alongside MIT and AGPL v3

We are committed to open-source, offering as many parts under MIT and AGPL v3 licenses. However, not all of our software can be licensed this way due to:

### Sustainability

Maintaining and supporting high-quality software requires significant resources. Commercial licensing helps cover these costs and supports ongoing development.

Thank you for understanding and supporting this balance.
