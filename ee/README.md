## What Parts Are Licensed Under the Commercial License
See [LICENSE](../LICENSE)

## Why We Use AGPL v3 and Not MIT

Packages licensed under MIT for the community are available at:
[GitHub - inbeta-group/monorepo](https://github.com/inbeta-group/monorepo).

We choose AGPL v3 for the following reasons:
- **Stronger Copyleft**: Ensures that all modifications and derivative works are also open-source.

## Why We Use Commercial Licenses Alongside AGPL v3

While we are committed to open-source and license many parts under MIT and AGPL v3, some of our software requires commercial licenses due to:

- **Sustainability**: Maintaining and supporting high-quality software demands significant resources.

Thank you for understanding and supporting this balance.
